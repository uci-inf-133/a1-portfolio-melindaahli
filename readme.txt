--Readme document for Melinda Li, melindxl@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, 
particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require 
it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at 
interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find 
them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. 
If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. 
But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is 
allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an 
   accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

    There were some potential warnings presented by the accesibility checker.

    Potential problems that I had were:

    1.1 Text Alternative
      I ignored this warning because I believed that the alt text matched the same information as the image, 
      the images were not decorative and thus needed an alt text attribute. Also, I felt that the images added 
      using the img tag did not need an additional long description outside of the alt text and accompanying 
      text on the page.

    1.3 Adaptable
      I ignored this because the problems listed stated that reading directions for languages with a different reading
      system were needed but my entire website is in English. Also, my labels are close to my input boxes as they are
      directly above the inputs. Text does not refer to other elements of the page by shape or other visual indicators either.

    1.4 Distinguishable
      I ignored this because I didn't refer the images only "by color," nor does the script and inputs "use color alone."
      Images that contain text are not relevant to what they are, and thus are unneeded in the alt text.

    2.1 Keyboard Accessible
      I ignored this because request was outside the scope of what we learned, and users using the tab and enter key on the 
      keyboard would be able to navigate the entire site.

    2.3 Seizures
      I ignored this because the current script does not behave in any way that causes screen flickers.
    
    2.4 Navigable
      I ignored this because there is no content before the main section that needs to be skipped. 
      Additionally all groups of links are marked, and the link text is representative of its destination.
      A site map is not needed for small websites according to Google:
      https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview
      Also, my heading tags were used as I intended them to be used (as headers) rather than for formatting.
    
    3.1 Readable
      I ignored this because my website actually does not include any words that are not English.

    3.2 Predictable
      I ignored this because repeated components always appear in the same relative order every time they appear and 
      I don't quote at all so it would not be appropriate the use the blockquote element.

    3.3 Input Assistance
      I ignonred this because all input forms are indicated as required and give users an error message when fields are left blank.
      Labels do in-fact describe their associated control. Inputs do describe the purpose of their function.
      Other suggested features are beyond the scope of what we've learned.
